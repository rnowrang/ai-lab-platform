# AI Lab Platform - Data Management Sync Resolution

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### **Issue 1: Admin Upload Permissions**
- **Problem**: Files uploaded through admin portal had incorrect ownership (`exxact:exxact`)
- **Impact**: Environments couldn't access admin uploaded datasets
- **File**: `ai-lab-data/shared/datasets/sdfdsf/test.html`

### **Issue 2: User Data Inconsistency** 
- **Problem**: Admin portal showed files for users with deleted environments
- **Impact**: Mismatched data between admin view and actual files
- **Example**: `test-user@example.com` had data but no active environments

### **Issue 3: Data Path Split-Brain (Discovered)**
- **Problem**: Existing environments used old path `/opt/ai-lab-data/`
- **Impact**: Admin uploads only visible in project path `/home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/ai-lab-data/`
- **Root cause**: Environments created before path unification

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **1. Permission Fix**
```bash
sudo chown -R llurad:docker ai-lab-data/shared/
sudo find ai-lab-data/shared/ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
sudo find ai-lab-data/shared/ -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
```
**Result**: All shared data now has correct permissions for environment access

### **2. User Data Cleanup**
- **Identified**: 1 orphaned user (`test-user@example.com`)
- **Action**: Backed up to `/home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/ai-lab-data/admin/backups/orphaned_20250610_163247/`
- **Action**: Removed orphaned data directories
- **Result**: Admin portal now syncs with actual user environments

### **3. Data Path Synchronization**
```bash
sudo rsync -av /home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/ai-lab-data/shared/ /opt/ai-lab-data/shared/
```
**Result**: Admin uploads now visible in both existing and new environments

### **4. API Cleanup Integration**
- **Action**: Called `POST /api/environments/cleanup` to sync resource tracking
- **Result**: Backend tracking now matches actual containers

## 🧪 Verification Results

### **Admin Portal Access**
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "datasets": [
    {"name": "Benchmark", "size_human": "2.2 KB"},
    {"name": "TestDataset", "size_human": "13.0 B"},
    {"name": "sdfdsf", "size_human": "0.0 B"}
  ]
}
```
✅ **API correctly returns all datasets including admin uploaded "sdfdsf"**

### **Environment Access**
```bash
# In environment ai-lab-pytorch-jupyter-1749597331
jovyan@container:/home/jovyan$ ls -la shared/datasets/
total 20
drwxrwxr-x 5 1001 999 4096 Jun 10 23:01 .
drwxrwxr-x 4 1001 999 4096 Jun 10 05:54 ..
drwxrwxr-x 2 1001 999 4096 Jun  9 23:35 Benchmark
drwxrwxr-x 2 1001 999 4096 Jun 10 23:01 sdfdsf  # ← Admin uploaded dataset now visible!
drwxrwxr-x 2 1001 999 4096 Jun  9 23:40 TestDataset
```
✅ **Environments can now access admin uploaded datasets**

### **User Data Consistency**
- **Tracked users**: 6 users with active environments
- **Orphaned data**: 0 (cleaned up)
- **Data sync**: Admin portal matches filesystem

## 🔧 Script Created

### **sync-data-management.sh**
**Features**:
- **Permission fixing**: Corrects ownership and permissions for shared data
- **Environment analysis**: Shows active vs tracked environments  
- **Orphan cleanup**: Identifies and removes orphaned user data (with backup)
- **API integration**: Syncs backend tracking with actual containers
- **Access verification**: Tests data accessibility from environments
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Generates detailed sync reports

**Usage**:
```bash
sudo ./sync-data-management.sh
```

## 📊 Data Architecture

### **Current State (Fixed)**
```
/home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/ai-lab-data/  # Primary unified location
├── shared/                                 # ← Admin uploads processed here
│   ├── datasets/                          # ← All datasets (including admin uploads)
│   │   ├── Benchmark/
│   │   ├── TestDataset/
│   │   └── sdfdsf/                        # ← Admin uploaded dataset
│   └── notebooks/
├── users/                                 # ← User-specific data
│   ├── demo_at_ailab_com/
│   ├── test_at_ailab_com/
│   └── test2_at_ailab_com/
└── admin/                                # ← Admin data and reports
    └── backups/                          # ← Orphaned data backups

/opt/ai-lab-data/                         # Legacy production location (synced)
└── shared/ → synced from primary location
```

### **Data Flow (Fixed)**
1. **Admin uploads** → `ai-lab-data/shared/datasets/` (correct permissions)
2. **Sync script** → Syncs to `/opt/ai-lab-data/shared/` for existing environments
3. **New environments** → Use unified path via `HOST_DATA_PATH`
4. **All environments** → Can access admin uploaded data

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

### **1. Automated Sync Integration**
Add to post-reboot automation:
```bash
# Sync shared data for existing environments
sudo rsync -av /home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/ai-lab-data/shared/ /opt/ai-lab-data/shared/
```

### **2. Admin Upload Hooks**
Consider adding a post-upload hook that:
- Sets correct permissions automatically
- Syncs to legacy location for existing environments
- Validates accessibility

### **3. Regular Data Sync**
Run sync script periodically:
```bash
# Weekly data management sync (add to cron)
0 2 * * 0 /home/llurad/ai-lab-platform/sync-data-management.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### **4. Environment Recreation Guidance**
For users with old environments, recommend:
```bash
# Recreate environment to use unified data path
# Old environments will eventually be replaced naturally
```
