# AI Lab Platform - Deployment Decision Guide

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Docker Compose | K3s (Kubernetes) |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **User Count** | 1-50 users | 50+ users |
| **Setup Time** | 30 minutes | 2-3 hours |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium-High |
| **GPU Efficiency** | Good | Excellent |
| **Scalability** | Single node | Multi-node |
| **Migration** | → Can upgrade to K3s | ← Can downgrade to Docker |

## Start with Docker Compose if:

- ✅ You have fewer than 50 users
- ✅ You want to get running quickly
- ✅ You prefer simple operations
- ✅ Single server is sufficient
- ✅ You're evaluating the platform

## Start with K3s if:

- ✅ You have 50+ users
- ✅ You need multi-node clustering
- ✅ You want advanced GPU scheduling
- ✅ You need high availability
- ✅ You have Kubernetes experience

## Migration Path: Docker → K3s

### When to Consider Migration

Switch from Docker to K3s when you experience:

1. **Performance bottlenecks**
   - GPU scheduling conflicts
   - Memory/CPU contention
   - Storage I/O limits

2. **Scaling needs**
   - Need for multiple nodes
   - Want to add more GPUs
   - Require load balancing

3. **Feature requirements**
   - Advanced GPU sharing (MIG, time-slicing)
   - Automatic failover
   - Better resource isolation

### What Transfers Seamlessly

✅ **All User Data**
- Home directories
- Projects
- Notebooks
- Models

✅ **MLflow Data**
- Experiments
- Models
- Artifacts
- Metrics

✅ **Configurations**
- Environment variables
- User quotas
- GPU allocations

✅ **Container Images**
- All Docker images work in K3s
- No rebuild required

### Migration Process

1. **Backup Everything** (30 mins)
   ```bash
   sudo ./migrate_docker_to_k3s.sh
   ```

2. **Install K3s** (1-2 hours)
   - Automated by migration script
   - Includes all optimizations

3. **Data Migration** (30-60 mins)
   - Automatic PostgreSQL migration
   - File system data preserved

4. **Verification** (30 mins)
   - Test user logins
   - Verify GPU access
   - Check data integrity

### Total Migration Time: 3-4 hours

## Rollback Options

### K3s → Docker

If K3s doesn't work out, you can rollback:

```bash
# Stop K3s
sudo systemctl stop k3s

# Restore Docker deployment
cd /opt/backups/docker_to_k3s_[timestamp]
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Restore data
docker exec -i ai-lab-postgres psql -U postgres < postgres_full_backup.sql
```

### Docker → Previous State

Docker deployments can be rolled back easily:

```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Restore from backup
docker exec -i ai-lab-postgres psql -U postgres < /opt/backups/postgres_backup.sql

# Restart services
docker-compose up -d
```

## Try Before You Commit

### Docker Trial (Recommended First)

1. Deploy with Docker Compose
2. Run for 2-4 weeks
3. Monitor performance
4. Gather user feedback
5. Decide if K3s is needed

### Parallel Testing

You can run both side-by-side:

```bash
# Docker on ports 80/443
# K3s on ports 8080/8443

# Test K3s while Docker runs production
./deploy_k3s_optimized.sh --ports 8080,8443
```

## Performance Comparison

### Docker Compose Performance
- **GPU Utilization**: 85-90%
- **Container Startup**: 10-30 seconds
- **API Latency**: 50-100ms
- **Max Concurrent Users**: ~50

### K3s Performance
- **GPU Utilization**: 95-98% (with MIG)
- **Pod Startup**: 20-40 seconds
- **API Latency**: 30-80ms
- **Max Concurrent Users**: 200+

## Cost Considerations

### Docker Compose
- **Infrastructure**: Single server
- **Operational**: 2-4 hours/week
- **Training**: Minimal

### K3s
- **Infrastructure**: Multiple nodes possible
- **Operational**: 4-8 hours/week
- **Training**: Kubernetes knowledge required

## Recommendations by Use Case

### Research Lab (10-30 users)
**Recommendation**: Start with Docker
- Simple management
- Quick deployment
- Easy backups

### University Department (50-100 users)
**Recommendation**: Start with K3s
- Better resource allocation
- User isolation
- Scalability

### Enterprise (100+ users)
**Recommendation**: K3s required
- Multi-node support
- High availability
- Advanced monitoring

### Personal/Small Team (<10 users)
**Recommendation**: Docker only
- Minimal overhead
- Simple operations
- Cost effective

## Migration Checklist

Before migrating Docker → K3s:

- [ ] Current deployment stable for 2+ weeks
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Users notified of maintenance window
- [ ] DNS changes planned
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] 4-hour maintenance window scheduled

## Summary

**Start with Docker Compose** - It's simpler and you can always upgrade to K3s later if needed. The migration path is well-defined and preserves all your data.

**Only start with K3s if** you know you need its advanced features from day one or have 50+ users.

The migration script makes switching relatively painless, taking about 3-4 hours with minimal downtime.
